# Questions

Just thinking out loud so to speak about how I see pull requests being used with individual work in a classroom environment and our LMS processes.

1. Student will review the lesson material in the LMS.
2. Student will do their work in a branch.
3. Student will commit what they think is the end result to fulfill the project direction requirements.
4. Student will push the branch to the repo.
5. Student will create pull request as a way to say they are ready for grading.
6. Instructor will review the code and add comments (i.e. create issues) to help guide students into correcting their code.
7. Instructor will provide overall grade feedback and score within LMS.

Thought: Would instructors wait for the student to correct the errors to approve the request or force students to fix the issues then approve?
